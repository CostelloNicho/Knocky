# Knocky
Knocky is a re-imagining of the popular game Nok Hockey. Its aim is to create a competitive game that people can play in real time or at their own pace.

## About this repository:

This repository is an open source version of the iOS Game Knocky. It is not complete as I am not licensed to release the third party tools used. Eventually I would like to rebuild the game in unity 5, with Unity's native ui and 2d frameworks. The following has been removed:

-Tk2dToolKit
-Prime31's Game Center plugin
